<!-- I know we were told to change texts to customize for ourselves but I currentyl dont know what to write and also
 I think its best I wait since I dont have much to my name with coding so I can add it as i go 
 This is just a comment for teachers reading this code and also for myself.-->

 <!-- Also just another comment for the overall of the sylesheet and the HTML, 
  Im not exactly too sure how I feel about the creativity of my portfolio website,
  but I prefer it being anime themed, Im not exactly too sure about the colors and styles yet
  but I will figure that out as I update this website, I kept relatively the same layour
 as the template, I mean its simple Im just gonna keep building upon it and maybe change or add stuff later
 -->

 <!-- ALL TEXT IN THIS HTML IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE, AND ALSO ON THE CSS STYLESHEET,
  THAT CAN ALSO CHANGE CONSIDERING I DONT KNOW IF I LOVE IT OR NOT so keep that in mind
