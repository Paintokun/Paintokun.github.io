# C# Projects

These are some projects I worked on while learning C# and the .NET Framework

## Projects

- Car Insurance Calculator

- CurrentDateandTime

- TicTacToe game

- Functioning Calculator

## Car Insurance Calculator

This project is an MVC web application that simulates a basic car insurance website. It takes user
input such as age, vehicle information, and driving history, then calculates an insurance quote
based on set business rules.

##CurrentDateandTime

This was a smaller project that just shows the current time on websites, when refreshed the time will always be the same

##TicTacToe

This project implimented the use of Images and Sounds while playing the game triggering when certain conditions were met (Wins, Losses and Spots picked)
This game had a lot of conditions that needed to be met for certain functions to work properly

##Calculator

This is a basic calculator that performs standard arithmetic operations.
